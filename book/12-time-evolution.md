# Chapter 12: From Hamiltonian to Time Evolution

_We have a Pauli-sum Hamiltonian. A quantum computer doesn't execute Hamiltonians — it executes gates. This chapter bridges the gap._

## In This Chapter

- **What you'll learn:** Why quantum simulation requires time evolution $e^{-iHt}$, why this is hard to implement directly, and how product formulas (Trotterization) provide a practical approximation.
- **Why this matters:** Trotterization is the standard method for converting a Hamiltonian into a gate sequence. Without it, the entire pipeline from molecule to circuit is incomplete.
- **Prerequisites:** Chapters 1–11 (you have a verified, optionally tapered, Pauli-sum Hamiltonian).

## The Gap in Our Pipeline

So far, our pipeline produces a symbolic object:

$$\hat{H} = \sum_{k=1}^{L} c_k P_k$$

where each $P_k$ is a Pauli string (like $XXYY$) and $c_k$ is a real coefficient. This is the qubit Hamiltonian — verified in Chapter 7, optionally tapered in Chapters 8–11.

But a quantum computer doesn't accept a Hamiltonian as input. It accepts a sequence of **quantum gates** — unitary operations that act on specific qubits. The gap is:

$$\text{Hamiltonian } \hat{H} \;\xrightarrow{\;?\;}\; \text{Gate sequence}$$

The bridge is **Hamiltonian simulation**: implementing the time-evolution operator $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ as a circuit of elementary gates.

## Why Time Evolution?

The Schrödinger equation governs how a quantum state evolves:

$$i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}\lvert\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}\lvert\psi(t)\rangle$$

The solution for time-independent $\hat{H}$ is:

$$\lvert\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}\lvert\psi(0)\rangle$$

The operator $U(t) = e^{-i\hat{H}t}$ (setting $\hbar = 1$) is the **time-evolution operator**. It is unitary, and implementing it as a quantum circuit is the fundamental task of Hamiltonian simulation.

Both major quantum chemistry algorithms use this:
- **VQE** measures $\langle\psi\rvert\hat{H}\lvert\psi\rangle$ by measuring each Pauli term separately — each measurement requires a basis rotation that involves a Pauli rotation $e^{-i\theta P_k}$.
- **QPE** applies controlled-$U(t)$ to extract eigenvalues by phase kickback.

In both cases, the primitive operation is a **Pauli rotation**: $e^{-i\theta P}$ for a single Pauli string $P$.

## The Problem: Non-Commuting Terms

If the Hamiltonian had a single term, $\hat{H} = cP$, then:

$$e^{-i\hat{H}t} = e^{-ictP}$$

This is a single Pauli rotation — easy to implement (Chapter 14 will show exactly how). But our Hamiltonian has $L$ terms:

$$\hat{H} = c_1 P_1 + c_2 P_2 + \cdots + c_L P_L$$

and the terms generally **do not commute**: $P_j P_k \neq P_k P_j$. This means:

$$e^{-i(c_1 P_1 + c_2 P_2)t} \neq e^{-ic_1 P_1 t} \cdot e^{-ic_2 P_2 t}$$

The exponential of a sum is *not* the product of exponentials for non-commuting operators. This is where Trotterization enters.

## The Trotter Idea

The Trotter–Suzuki product formula says that for small $\Delta t$:

$$e^{-i(A + B)\Delta t} \approx e^{-iA\Delta t} \cdot e^{-iB\Delta t} + O(\Delta t^2)$$

The error is proportional to $\Delta t^2$ — so if we break the total time $t$ into $N$ small steps of size $\Delta t = t/N$:

$$e^{-i\hat{H}t} = \left(e^{-i\hat{H}\Delta t}\right)^N \approx \left(\prod_{k=1}^{L} e^{-ic_k P_k \Delta t}\right)^N$$

Each factor $e^{-ic_k P_k \Delta t}$ is a single Pauli rotation — implementable as a gate sequence. The full circuit is just $N$ repetitions of $L$ rotations.

```

**Trade-off:** More Trotter steps ($N$) → better approximation but deeper circuit. Fewer steps → shallower circuit but larger error. The choice of $N$ depends on the target precision and the commutator structure of $\hat{H}$.

## First vs Second Order

The formula above is **first-order Trotter**: error $O(\Delta t^2)$ per step, $O(t^2/N)$ total.

**Second-order Trotter** (Suzuki) cuts the error to $O(\Delta t^3)$ by symmetrizing:

$$e^{-i\hat{H}\Delta t} \approx \prod_{k=1}^{L} e^{-ic_k P_k \Delta t/2} \cdot \prod_{k=L}^{1} e^{-ic_k P_k \Delta t/2}$$

The forward pass uses half-angles, the reverse pass mirrors the sequence. The cost is $2L$ rotations per step instead of $L$, but the error decreases faster, so you need fewer steps for the same precision.

| Order | Rotations per step | Error per step | Error for $N$ steps |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| First | $L$ | $O(\Delta t^2)$ | $O(t^2/N)$ |
| Second | $2L$ | $O(\Delta t^3)$ | $O(t^3/N^2)$ |

For most molecular simulations, second-order Trotter with a moderate $N$ is the standard choice.

## What Comes Next

The Trotter decomposition converts our Hamiltonian into a list of Pauli rotations:

$$\text{Hamiltonian } \hat{H} \;\xrightarrow{\text{Trotter}}\; [e^{-i\theta_1 P_1},\; e^{-i\theta_2 P_2},\; \ldots]$$

Each rotation $e^{-i\theta P}$ must then be decomposed into elementary gates (H, CNOT, Rz). That's the **CNOT staircase** — Chapter 14. But first, Chapter 13 will show how FockMap computes the rotation list.

## Key Takeaways

- Quantum computers execute gates, not Hamiltonians. The bridge is time evolution $e^{-i\hat{H}t}$.
- Non-commuting Pauli terms prevent direct exponentiation. The Trotter–Suzuki formula approximates $e^{-i(A+B)t}$ as a product of individual rotations.
- First-order Trotter: $L$ rotations, $O(t^2/N)$ error. Second-order: $2L$ rotations, $O(t^3/N^2)$ error.
- The quality of the Trotter approximation depends on the time step size and the commutator norm $\lVert[P_j, P_k]\rVert$ — smaller commutators mean smaller errors.
