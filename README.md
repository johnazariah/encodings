**A practical F# library for symbolic operator algebra on Fock space and fermion-to-qubit encodings.**

> Learn by doing: pick an encoding, map operators to Pauli strings, and compare results.

---

## Why FockMap

If you're exploring quantum chemistry on qubits, you usually hit this question quickly: **how do I map fermions to Pauli operators?**

FockMap gives you one small, consistent API for that. You can:
- use built-in encodings (Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, Parity, tree-based)
- compare them side-by-side
- define your own encoding with a few lines of F#

| Feature | OpenFermion | Qiskit Nature | **FockMap** |
|---------|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Define a new encoding | ~200 lines Python | Not supported | **3–5 lines F#** |
| Tree → encoding pipeline | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** |
| Type-safe operator algebra | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** |
| Pure functional, zero mutation | ❌ | ❌ | **✅** |
| Symbolic Pauli algebra (no matrices) | ❌ | Partial | **✅** |
| Runtime dependencies | NumPy, SciPy | Many | **None** |

Internally, the library uses exact symbolic Pauli algebra (not floating-point matrix multiplication), so encoded operator manipulation stays fast and predictable.

## Available Encodings

| Encoding | Worst-Case Pauli Weight | Framework | Function |
|----------|:-----------------------:|:---------:|----------|
| Jordan-Wigner | $O(n)$ | Index-set | `jordanWignerTerms` |
| Bravyi-Kitaev | $O(\log_2 n)$ | Index-set | `bravyiKitaevTerms` |
| Parity | $O(n)$ | Index-set | `parityTerms` |
| Balanced Binary Tree | $O(\log_2 n)$ | Path-based | `balancedBinaryTreeTerms` |
| Balanced Ternary Tree | $O(\log_3 n)$ | Path-based | `ternaryTreeTerms` |

All encodings return the same output type (`PauliRegisterSequence`), so you can swap schemes without rewriting downstream code.

## Installation

### NuGet (recommended)

```bash
dotnet add package FockMap
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnazariah/encodings.git
cd encodings
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

### Dev Container (for contributors)

This repository includes a full [dev container](https://containers.dev/) configuration with .NET 10, F#, Python, LaTeX, and all required tooling pre-installed. To use it:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code
3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** (or run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` from the command palette)
4. The container builds, restores packages, compiles the project, and runs tests automatically

Everything is pre-configured, so you can start coding immediately.

## Quick Start

```fsharp
open Encodings

// Encode the creation operator a†₂ on 4 modes using Jordan-Wigner
let pauliJW = jordanWignerTerms Raise 2u 4u
// → ½(ZZXI) − ½i(ZZYI)

// Same operator under Bravyi-Kitaev (O(log n) weight)
let pauliBK = bravyiKitaevTerms Raise 2u 4u

// Or Parity encoding
let pauliP = parityTerms Raise 2u 4u

// Tree-based encodings
let pauliBBT = balancedBinaryTreeTerms Raise 2u 4u
let pauliBTT = ternaryTreeTerms Raise 2u 4u
```

### Encode a Full Hamiltonian

```fsharp
open Encodings

// One-electron (h) and two-electron (g) integrals for H₂ in STO-3G basis
let h = Array2D.init 4 4 (fun i j -> (* your integrals *) 0.0)
let g = Array4D.init 4 4 4 4 (fun i j k l -> (* your integrals *) 0.0)

// Encode with any scheme
let hamiltonian = computeHamiltonianWith jordanWignerTerms h g 4u
```

### Define a Custom Encoding

```fsharp
open Encodings

// Build a custom tree and derive an encoding from it
let myTree = balancedBinaryTree 8
let myScheme = treeEncodingScheme myTree
let myEncode op j n = encodeOperator myScheme op j n
```

## How it Works (briefly)

FockMap exposes two fermionic encoding styles:
- **Index-set encodings** (Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, Parity)
- **Tree/path encodings** (balanced binary and ternary trees, plus custom trees)

It also supports **bosonic ladder-operator normal ordering** via canonical commutation relations (CCR), alongside the fermionic CAR workflow.

For models with both statistics, use sector-tagged operators (`fermion`, `boson`) and `constructMixedNormalOrdered` to canonicalize mixed expressions.

## Examples

Runnable F# scripts in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory:

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| [`H2_Encoding.fsx`](examples/H2_Encoding.fsx) | Encode the H₂ molecular Hamiltonian with all 5 encodings |
| [`Compare_Encodings.fsx`](examples/Compare_Encodings.fsx) | Side-by-side Pauli weight comparison across encodings |
| [`Custom_Encoding.fsx`](examples/Custom_Encoding.fsx) | Build a custom Majorana encoding from index-set functions |
| [`Custom_Tree.fsx`](examples/Custom_Tree.fsx) | Construct a custom tree and derive an encoding from it |
| [`Mixed_NormalOrdering.fsx`](examples/Mixed_NormalOrdering.fsx) | Canonical mixed boson+fermion normal ordering with sector blocks |
| [`Mixed_ElectronPhonon_Toy.fsx`](examples/Mixed_ElectronPhonon_Toy.fsx) | Toy electron-phonon style mixed symbolic workflow |
| [`Mixed_HybridPipeline.fsx`](examples/Mixed_HybridPipeline.fsx) | Encode fermion sector to Pauli while keeping boson sector symbolic |

Run any example with:
```bash
dotnet fsi examples/H2_Encoding.fsx
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# With detailed output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

# With coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

The test suite covers encoding behavior, Pauli algebra laws, and cross-encoding consistency checks.

Coverage and test counts are tracked in CI.
